\setlength{\parskip}{6pt}

\noindent{}We present a novel algorithm for solving integer linear constraint
problems of the form $\v{l} \le \mat{A} \v{x} \le \v{u}$. Our approach is based
on techniques used to solve the closest vector problem for lattices, but adapted
to use the $\linf{}$ distance metric. We have implemented this algorithm in a
constraint solver called BLT.

\noindent{}The BLT solver was motivated by efforts to apply SMT solvers to
signal processing algorithms.  In particular, we describe here the problem of
\emph{reversing JPEG}, that is, finding compressed data that decompress into an
image satisfying given constraints.  This problem can be expressed as a bounded
integer linear constraint problem, but was intractable to the SMT solvers we
tried.  In contrast, BLT is able to solve many of the examples in seconds,
including both SAT and UNSAT problems.
